## Workspace, Tab, and Pane Navigation

- Create, rename, pin, switch, and close workspaces/tabs. Linked Git worktrees
  group under their repository; pins and collapsed groups stay in this browser.
- Split right/down, resize, focus neighbors, zoom, or close panes.
- Search workspaces, worktrees, files, tabs, panes, and agents in the command
  menu. Enter a relative/absolute path to open a file.
- Desktop **Zen mode** hides app chrome. Hover the top edge to reveal controls
  or use **Exit Zen**; the sidebar restores its previous state on exit.

Endpoint connections use **Local navigation** per browser/connection; legacy
connections use **Shared navigation**. Reconnect preserves selections; reload
starts from Herdr's selection. Same-tab pane focus, topology, and terminal sizes
remain shared. Creation preserves Herdr's cwd policy and requires a connected
source terminal, except for the first workspace in an empty session and the
[project launcher](#project-launcher), which always names its folder.
See [compatibility](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md#herdr-compatibility).

### Recent Pane Switcher

Switch across tabs/workspaces using the 12 most recently focused live panes plus
the current layout. Use Up/Down; release the opening modifier or press Enter to
switch, Esc to cancel. On macOS, hold Ctrl and repeat Tab (Shift reverses).
Entries show workspace, tab, pane ID, cwd, and agent status; closed panes leave
history. Press K while the switcher is open to start searching, even while
holding the opening modifiers (and Shift when cycling backwards).

### Pane Search

`Alt+K` opens the same switcher in search mode over **every** live pane, not
just recent ones, so a pane never visited stays reachable. Filter on workspace,
tab, cwd, or agent name/status; terms match in any order, all must match, and
results keep their recent-first order. Up/Down or Tab/Shift+Tab move, Enter
switches, `Alt+K` or Esc closes. Search never commits on a modifier release, so
it stays open while typing. K (including with the opening modifiers held) or
`Alt+K` inside the recent switcher converts it in place without opening the
command menu. The current pane stays listed for context, but selection starts on
the first pane a jump can reach.

### Project Launcher

Start Claude or Codex in a frequently used folder without typing `cd`: tap the folder button in the phone's floating controls (or run **Launch agent in folder** from the command menu), pick a folder, and tap **Claude** or **Codex**.
The folder list comes from the connected host, local or SSH: **Pinned** folders you add, remove, and reorder (**Edit**), then **Recent** folders ranked from your earlier launches, directories open in Herdr (workspace checkouts and pane working directories), and `zoxide query` when zoxide is installed on that host.
Duplicates, missing directories, the home directory, and `/` are left out of Recent; a pinned folder that disappears stays listed as missing until you unpin it.
Type a filter, an absolute or `~/` path, or browse the host's folders.
If an open workspace already works in that folder, the agent opens in a new tab there; otherwise a new workspace opens rooted at the folder.
Thyra focuses the new tab after the shell draws its prompt and types the configured command followed by Enter.
Commands default to `claude` and `codex` and are edited under the launcher's settings button or **Configuration > Connection**; pins, commands, and launch history are saved on the Thyra server per connection, so every device shares them.
The browser only chooses an agent, never the command text.

## Full Browser Terminal

- Server-rendered terminals support normal input, modified Enter, macOS editing
  keys, multiline paste, IME, and CJK punctuation.
- Scroll by wheel, trackpad, touch, or explicit half-page history shortcuts.
  Full page keys route to terminal apps or Herdr history; unavailable endpoint
  history controls explain missing support.
- Pane apps see the browser's terminal colors: OSC 10/11/4 queries and
  color-scheme reports (`?996n`, mode 2031) follow the page's terminal theme,
  so Codex and Claude Code (`/theme` auto) render for a light page. Codex
  re-reads on focus; restart it if it keeps the old scheme.
- Terminals render on the GPU (WebGL2) when available, with pixel-exact box
  drawing and Powerline glyphs and programming ligatures in the bundled
  Maple Mono NF CN (Nerd Font icons, CJK at exactly two cells); they fall back
  to the DOM renderer otherwise. The font is sliced by unicode-range, so a page
  downloads only the chunks for characters it shows. The first output appears
  in a fallback font; the GPU renderer and the font follow without resizing it.
- Mouse-aware apps receive pane-local clicks/drags/wheels. Select browser text
  with Option-drag (macOS) or Shift-drag (elsewhere); ordinary output needs no
  modifier. Releasing a selection copies it, as in Herdr. Selection freezes
  presentation until cleared. To select more than a screen, drag to the edge or
  scroll the wheel while holding the button; after release, scroll and
  Shift-click to extend. Streaming output below does not interrupt it.
- Paste images to upload them to the connected host and insert their paths.
  OSC 52 clipboard writes follow Herdr's foreground recipient, not proven source
  pane ownership; see [clipboard limits](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md#herdr-compatibility).
- `Cmd/Ctrl`-click HTTP(S) links to open a browser tab; file/directory paths open
  preview/workspace actions. Touch uses long-press, then **Open link** or
  **File actions**. Nothing opens on hover or ordinary touch.

Herdr 0.9.1 supports read-only wrapped-link resolution; OSC 8 keeps explicit
full destinations. Viewport-clipped plain URLs cannot be recovered safely.
Older servers retain local URL/path detection; legacy touch lacks explicit OSC 8
metadata. See [link contracts](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#links).

## Workspace Inspector

Open **Files**, **Changes**, or **Agent History** from the Inspector button,
keyboard shortcuts, or workspace/agent menus.

- Dock right/bottom, resize, or expand without unmounting terminals. Narrow
  layouts use drill-down/overlay views; Esc dismisses transient UI, not Inspector.
- Tab switches keep Inspector open; workspace switches restore checkout-scoped
  selection/layout. Files and Changes save separate widths. Closing returns to
  the originating tab if it still exists.
- Agent browsing starts at its cwd only inside the checkout. Terminal links use
  their pane's workspace. Changes describe the checkout, not agent ownership.
- Closed worktrees must open before browsing; missing ones offer cleanup, never
  sibling files. Directory previews can prefill **New workspace**.

Inspector leaves the sidebar unchanged. Previews stay read-only
until **Edit** opens the file editor;
[resource ownership](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#workspace-resource-ownership) prevents
cross-worktree state mixing.

## Agent Awareness and Session Inspection

- See recognized agents and working/blocked/done/idle status; focus their panes
  from the tree, switcher, command menu, Agent panel, or notifications.
- Agent rows show the agent icon with the pane's name (its Herdr pane name,
  a custom single-pane tab name, or its directory) and a code-style pane ID;
  the agent name is not repeated. Tabs holding several panes appear as a
  heading that groups their agent rows. Pane headers show the same name and
  a click-to-copy pane ID.
- Choose nested agents, **Agents: Separate**, or **Agents: Compact**. Separate
  supports attention-first, workspace/manual ordering, grouping, and dragging
  in ungrouped manual mode. Idle recency uses session-file activity, falling
  back to Herdr state changes. Preferences are browser-local; manual order is
  per connection.
- **Agent History** has User/Agent/Tool filters, loaded-text search, a minimap,
  and on-demand tool details. Its recent window is 200 conversation entries plus associated tools;
  exports stay complete. **Session Inspector** adds metadata, Timeline,
  searchable ATIF/raw transcripts, and original/normalized export.
- **Menu > Configuration > Integrations** installs, updates, or uninstalls
  Herdr's bundled integrations with confirmation, not agent applications.
  Changes affect the connected server user across sessions, including SSH.
  Restart agent sessions if reporting has not started. Version metadata uses
  Herdr's API with a same-host CLI fallback; “available” means bundled, not an
  online release. See [integration version lookup](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#agent-integrations).

Session inspection supports **Codex, Claude, Kimi, Grok Build, Pi, Muse Code,
and Antigravity CLI** with readable records. Missing metadata shows integration
guidance where an integration is available. Muse uses the newest retained session
matching the foreground working directory under
`$XDG_DATA_HOME/muse/sessions` (default `~/.local/share/muse/sessions`), or a
Herdr-reported session ID/path. Start Muse without `--no-session-log` to retain
transcripts; sessions in the same directory require an explicit ID/path to
distinguish them reliably. SSH reads Herdr-reported paths and Pi ID lookups
remotely; Muse requires a reported path over SSH and never searches local files
for a remote pane. Other ID/directory fallbacks remain local and require
accessible transcripts. Muse token totals use per-run provider routing; when a
cached-token convention is unknown, totals show `-` rather than an estimate.
See [History synchronization](docs/HISTORY.md).

## Git Worktree Lifecycle

Open **Worktree Lifecycle** from a workspace menu or the command menu to:

- Create a linked worktree from `origin`'s freshly fetched default branch,
  without changing the source branch or dirty files; discover/open existing
  worktrees. The default branch is queried from the remote, not cached `origin/HEAD`;
  an unavailable remote or unresolved default branch stops creation.
- Inspect paths, open/closed state, branch status, and uncommitted counts.
- Focus, pull, configure branch updates, or remove with confirmation, hooks,
  process cleanup, and preservation of residual files when safe removal fails.

Worktree creation and automatic branch updates fetch the advertised default
commit by its object ID without rewriting remote-tracking refs or `FETCH_HEAD`.
Stale tracking-ref names do not block creation or sync, and both operations use
the resolved commit rather than a ref that another fetch could change.

### Paseo Worktree Hooks

`paseo.json` supports `setup`, `opened`, `teardown`, and `removed` hooks.
**Hooks are enabled by default and execute trusted, unsandboxed repository code**
on the connected host. Review them or disable them under **Worktree hooks** /
**Worktree Lifecycle** before acting. Failed teardown stops removal; other hook
failures do not undo completed operations.
See [configuration and variables](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md#worktree-hooks).

### Automatic Branch Updates

Opt in per checkout through workspace menus, Worktree Lifecycle, or
**Configuration > Connection > Automatic branch updates**. Updates fetch and
merge `origin`'s default branch every 10 minutes by default, only while the
workspace is open in that connection. Each update queries the remote's current
default branch; if it cannot be resolved or fetched, the update fails without
merging. Updates skip dirty/detached checkouts, recheck branch/HEAD and worktree
after fetch, and abort conflicts. They never push.

## File Explorer and Preview

- Browse cached trees, toggle hidden files, and filter **loaded** names/paths
  with case-insensitive substrings or globs (`*`, `?`, `[]`, `{}`, `**`).
  Git badges mark changes; ignored files are dimmed.
- The explorer header switches between **Workspace** (the checkout tree) and
  **Filesystem** (any path on the connected host, local or SSH). Filesystem mode
  has back/forward/up, clickable breadcrumbs, a path bar (click the path; `~`
  and `~/...` resolve to the host user's home), quick locations (workspace
  root, pane directories, Home, `/`), a loaded-entry filter, and hidden-file
  toggle. Arrow keys move between rows; Backspace or Left goes up. Each
  explorer remembers its mode and directory until the page reloads; opening an
  agent's files at a cwd outside the checkout starts in Filesystem mode there.
- Both modes create files and folders, upload (button or drop), and delete with
  confirmation. Files outside the checkout preview and download like workspace
  files.
- Text previews provide highlighting, line numbers, search, and refresh.
  Markdown has a Preview/Source switch with the active mode highlighted;
  Mermaid fences and `.mmd`/`.mermaid` files
  have zoomable diagrams and source views. Markdown links navigate within
  Inspector; external links open a browser tab.
- Workspace `.html`/`.htm` files open in Preview mode with a Preview/Source switch.
  Static previews support workspace CSS, images, and fonts, including relative
  CSS imports, plus HTTPS CDN stylesheets. Scripts, external images and external
  fonts are blocked; HTML source is limited to 512 KiB. Files outside the workspace
  remain available as source or downloads.
- **Edit** opens complete text previews up to 512 KiB in a Monaco editor with
  syntax highlighting for common languages. **Save** or Ctrl/Cmd+S writes the file
  back to its host, including SSH connections and absolute filesystem paths;
  **Revert** restores the last saved text. If the file changed on disk since it
  was opened, choose **Reload** or **Overwrite**. Unsaved drafts survive switching
  files and prompt before closing the editor or the page.
- Preview images (including SVG), PDFs, and local Markdown images with zoom/Fit.
  Unsupported binaries are download-only; decoding depends on the browser.
- Upload by dragging onto a checkout directory; download files or workspace
  `.tar.gz` directories; copy paths or delete with confirmation via right-click
  or long-press. Upload/delete stay checkout-scoped. Operations work over SSH.

## Diff Viewer

- Review **Working tree**, **Against main**, or **Last step** (the latest completed
  activity snapshot, not proof of agent ownership). See staged, unstaged,
  untracked, conflict, and branch-diff badges with added/deleted counts.
- Use side-by-side/unified desktop views; mobile is unified. Search and syntax
  highlighting work across diffs; images have previews. Large, truncated, and
  generated diffs start collapsed.
- File/folder context menus offer open, copy path, stage, unstage, mark resolved,
  discard unstaged, and delete untracked, plus repository-wide bulk actions.
  Destructive actions require confirmation. Status/content is rechecked to reject
  stale menus instead of destroying newer work.

Scope, view, wrapping, and selection persist per checkout/browser; wrapping is
separate for desktop/mobile. Jump from a diff to its file preview.

![Changes inspector showing a wrapped working-tree diff beside a live agent terminal](docs/images/thyra-desktop-changes.png)

## Mobile and PWA

- **Configuration > Appearance > Layout** selects Automatic/Mobile/Desktop.
  Automatic defaults to 768 CSS px (adjustable 320–2560); `?layout=mobile`,
  `desktop`, or `auto` overrides saved mode until a menu choice clears it.
  Agent/workspace panel order is saved separately for each layout.
- Touch reads output without opening the keyboard. Tap the last rows (where
  agent input boxes sit) or **Open device keyboard** to type; a tap higher up
  dismisses it without input. Long-press selects text and copies it on
  release; handles adjust and recopy. **Copy** and link actions stay
  available; **Done**/Esc exits.
  Scroll first to select older output. Selection freezes the displayed frame,
  not the connection; legacy streams resume at a 1 MiB buffered UTF-16 limit.
- The default grid holds latching **Ctrl**/**Alt**/**Shift**, Ctrl+C/D/R, Esc,
  Tab, Enter, arrows, and PgUp/PgDn.
- **Ctrl**, **Alt**, and **Shift** in the shortcut grid apply to the next key
  typed or tapped (Ctrl then `c` sends Ctrl+C, Shift then Tab sends Shift+Tab);
  double-tap to lock one on, tap again to release.
- Customize the floating `2×8` grid and up to four side buttons under
  **Configuration > Behavior > Mobile terminal shortcuts**. The Tabs sheet and
  pane controls work when the tab strip is hidden.
- **Voice typing** is always one tap away: the microphone in the pane header
  (desktop) or the floating microphone beside **Open device keyboard** (phones
  and tablets) dictates without opening the composer. Recognized text collects
  in a preview; **Insert** tidies it and types it into the pane, **Send** also
  presses Enter, and tapping the microphone again equals **Insert**. On a
  keyboard, hold **Ctrl+Alt+M** to talk and release to insert, or tap it to
  start and tap again to insert; Enter sends and Esc discards
  (**Configuration > Behavior > Keyboard shortcuts** can rebind it). The WebRTC voice activity
  detector finds speech after the browser's noise suppression, and the whole
  dictation is recognized once more in one request when you stop.
  Recognition falls back from cloud to local, a personal dictionary fixes
  names and terms, and the finished dictation is tidied by a language model
  (**Configuration > Behavior > Voice cleanup**).
- The composer supports IME, dictation, voice input, multiline text, and images.
  Its microphone dictates into the draft instead of the terminal. **Insert**
  does not execute; **Send** adds one Enter. Drafts are in-memory per
  connection/pane; closing their pane/tab/workspace asks before discarding.
- Install as a PWA for an app window; a bundled Nerd Font supplies terminal
  icons. **PWA is not offline access**: Thyra must remain reachable.
  See [installation steps](README.md#install-as-a-pwa).

## Remote, Multi-Client, and Operations

- Shared local/SSH profiles have independent browser selection. Disconnecting
  does not stop Herdr. SSH forwarding requires Linux/macOS; Windows supports
  native local profiles. [Connection setup](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md#multiple-and-remote-herdr-connections).
- Browsers receive pushed events; inspect client counts or pause/resume clients.
  **Configuration > Behavior > Task notifications** independently enables
  input-required/completed alerts. **Background push** works without an active
  page; **Active page only** does not. Delivery is best-effort.
  [Web Push setup and revocation](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md#web-push-notifications).
- Choose light/dark/system appearance, accents, built-in/custom terminal themes,
  and UI text size (80%–150%). Preferences stay in this browser.
- The interface is available in English and Simplified Chinese. **Language**
  under **Configuration > Appearance** defaults to **Auto**, which follows the
  browser's language; changing it reloads the page. The login page follows the
  browser's `Accept-Language`.
- **Configuration > Connection > Terminal incremental transport** saves a shared
  per-connection setting on the server. It reduces Herdr-to-Thyra traffic,
  briefly reconnecting displays without stopping tasks; older servers retain
  their transport.
- Manage [user services](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md#run-as-a-user-service), use
  checksum-verified standalone updates under a supported supervisor, and probe
  `/health` or `/healthz`.

**Loopback bypasses login even with a password.** Non-loopback requires a token
or password. UI access grants terminal/file authority, not a read-only role;
read [Security](./SECURITY.md) before sharing access.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

Open **Menu > Configuration > Behavior > Keyboard shortcuts** for the searchable
reference/editor. Automatic detects your platform; explicit/custom presets
support up to three bindings per action, unassignment, reset, and JSON
export/import. Editing built-ins creates a custom copy. Changes save immediately
and sync to same-origin tabs; conflicts are rejected.

Common defaults (Linux/Android exceptions follow):

| Action | macOS / iOS | Windows / Linux / Android |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Command menu | `Cmd+K` | `Ctrl+Alt+K` |
| Sidebar | `Cmd+B` | `Ctrl+Alt+B` |
| Workspace Inspector | `Cmd+Shift+B` | `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+B` |
| Expand / restore Inspector (desktop) | `Cmd+Option+Enter` | `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Enter` |
| Zen mode (desktop) | `Cmd+Shift+Z` | `Ctrl+Alt+Z` |
| Recent pane switcher | `Ctrl+Tab` | `Ctrl+Alt+J` |
| Search panes | `Alt+K` | `Alt+K` |
| Create / close tab or pane | `Cmd+T` / `Cmd+W` | `Ctrl+Alt+T` / `Ctrl+Alt+W` |
| Previous / next tab | `Cmd+Option+Left/Right` | `Alt+Shift+Left/Right` |
| Focus neighboring pane | `Cmd+Ctrl+Arrow` | `Ctrl+Shift+Arrow` |
| Split right / down | `Cmd+D` / `Cmd+Shift+D` | `Ctrl+Alt+D` / `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+D` |
| Zoom / restore pane | `Cmd+Shift+Enter` | `Ctrl+Alt+Enter` |
| Voice typing (hold to talk, tap to toggle) | `Ctrl+Option+M` | `Ctrl+Alt+M` |
| Numbered tab | `Ctrl+1…9` | `Ctrl+Alt+1…9` |
| Numbered command menu action | `Option+1…9` | `Alt+1…9` |
| Workspaces | `Ctrl+Shift+W` | `Ctrl+Alt+O` |
| File Explorer | `Cmd+Shift+E` | `Ctrl+Alt+E` |
| Diff Viewer | `Ctrl+Shift+G` | `Ctrl+Alt+G` |
| Agent history | `Cmd+Shift+H` | `Ctrl+Alt+H` |
| Search raw preview / diff | `Cmd+F` | `Ctrl+F` |
| Send composer | `Cmd+Enter` | `Ctrl+Enter` |
| Copy terminal selection | `Cmd+C` | `Ctrl+Shift+C` / `Ctrl+Insert` |
| Terminal paste | `Cmd+V` | `Ctrl+V` (also `Ctrl+Shift+V` on Linux) |
| Open terminal links / file paths | `Cmd+Click` | `Ctrl+Click` |

Linux/Android uses `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+T` for new tabs, `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+D` to split
right, and `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+S` to split down, avoiding desktop-reserved bindings.
Letter/number bindings use physical keys. Browsers/OSes can intercept shortcuts;
choose alternatives in the editor or use menus.

Copy needs a selection; plain `Ctrl+C` remains terminal input. Page/half-page
navigation and modified Enter are configurable. Native editing/IME/app keys
remain available; remapped paste requires the Clipboard API. Touch shortcuts
have a separate editor. Esc dismisses transient UI; Tab/arrows navigate controls,
except in the pane switcher's search, which keeps typing in its field;
Enter/Shift+Enter advances/reverses diff search.
