# Architecture

Thyra's system contracts. See [Features](../FEATURES.md) for UI behavior,
[Deployment](./DEPLOYMENT.md) for configuration, and [Security](../SECURITY.md)
for the trust model.

## System overview

```text
Browser (React + Vite)
   | same-origin HTTP / WebSocket
   v
Bridge (Bun + TypeScript) -- node:net --> Herdr sockets
```

Browsers cannot open Unix sockets or Windows named pipes. The bridge connects
`herdr.sock` (NDJSON control) and `herdr-client.sock` (binary terminal traffic),
serves the frontend, and owns authentication, local/SSH runtimes, host operations,
notifications, health, and updates. React owns presentation and browser-local
preferences; xterm displays Herdr-rendered output, not a bridge-owned PTY.

Browser RPC sends `{ id, method, params }` and receives `{ id, result }` or
`{ id, error }`. Subscribed events use `{ event: ... }`; downstream traffic also
carries connection identity. Subscription acknowledgements trigger snapshots;
events during refresh queue another refresh. This reconciles missed changes,
not an atomic or replayable event log.

## Connection isolation

A bridge-global `ConnectionManager` owns shared profiles and independent
`ConnectionRuntime` instances. Each runtime owns its transport, viewers,
subscriptions, clipboard relay, services, caches, and reconnect lifecycle.
Render streams open only while viewed. Disconnect/removal stops the runtime and
SSH tunnel, not Herdr or its workspaces.

- Downstream RPC/HTTP requires an immutable connection ID, runtime generation,
  and request-local ready-runtime lease. Replies, events, frames, and clipboard
  pushes carry that identity; HTTP streams recheck it per chunk.
- Replacement retires leases before publishing status. Already-dispatched effects
  may finish on the original host, but retired results cannot publish. Explicit
  malformed, unknown, stale, or unready identities fail without fallback.
  Omitted identities and legacy HTTP aliases are a bounded, logged compatibility
  path for older single-connection clients only.
- Authentication, health, updates, client accounting, and profile management are
  bridge-global and independent of downstream readiness. Global RPC rejects
  misleading connection fields. Starts/stops serialize; shutdown is bounded;
  one failed runtime does not block healthy connections or management.
- Browser caches, storage, mount keys, notifications, and async actions are
  connection-scoped. Switching connections retires the browser lease; same-ID
  runtime replacement clears active and inactive sessions before IDs can recur.

## Terminal endpoints

### Negotiation and transport

Backend selection uses a verified protocol allowlist, not browser inference.
[Compatibility](./DEPLOYMENT.md#herdr-compatibility) defines supported versions,
legacy fallback, and clipboard limitations.

Herdr 0.9.0 endpoints require generation 1 and exact codecs
`shell.snapshot.v1`, `shell.surface.v1`, `shell.input.semantic.v1`, and
`shell.blob.v1`. Unknown generations/codecs fail closed. Attachment waits for the
initial snapshot; each viewer crops its pane from the shared tab surface.

Capabilities belong to **each terminal socket**, are renegotiated on reattach,
and are checked again at dispatch:

| Capability | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| `pane.focus` | Required for attachment; absence fails without legacy takeover. |
| `pane.scroll` | Gates explicit history scrolling, not semantic page keys. |
| `tab.create`, `workspace.create` | Gate creation on the existing source endpoint. |
| `health_check` | Enables ping/pong; input and resize are core codec operations. |
| `surface_interest`, `presentation_effects_fence` | Do not authorize surface-setting or fencing controls. |

Endpoint hellos opt into `surface_delta` and `surface_reuse` by default, unless
disabled; each requires a matching welcome capability. Full surfaces, legacy patches,
Base64-bincode deltas, and JSON reuse controls share a connection-local baseline
before cropping. Legacy patches update named panes and replace the cursor
(including `null`); delta/reuse replaces pane, cursor, hyperlink, and scroll
metadata. Geometry changes require a full surface.

Decoders bound collections and validate boot/projection/surface revisions, spans,
and hyperlink indices. Invalid updates close the stream and clear its baseline;
viewers reattach for a fresh full frame rather than keep stale output. A
connection-wide endpoint observer follows the focused Space to report popup
identity even without pane viewers; the popup terminal uses direct attach.
Kitty graphics are not presented.

`settings.terminal_transport.get/update` persists `surface_codecs` per connection
in `settings.json`. Changes close that runtime's endpoint displays and broadcast
`settings.terminal_transport.updated`; viewers reattach with fresh baselines.
Queued attachments reread settings. Configuration closes do not consume takeover
retries; tasks, legacy sessions, and other runtimes are unaffected. This is a
shared preference, not an authorization boundary.

These codecs reduce **Herdr-to-bridge** traffic. On the bridge-to-browser leg,
a viewer that attaches with `frame_delta: true` receives endpoint repaints as
row updates (`shared/terminalFrame.ts`, `server/src/bridge/terminal-frame-stream.ts`).
Each frame carries `frame_seq`. A full frame sends every styled row in `rows`
plus the cursor `tail`. A row update names its `base_seq` and sends only
`changed` rows, plus `tail` when the cursor changed. Frames identical to the
last one sent to that viewer are not sent. The browser acknowledges each frame
with `terminal.frame_ack { terminal_id, seq }`. At most four frames or 16 KiB
are unacknowledged per viewer and terminal; newer frames replace the pending
one, so a slow link skips to the newest screen instead of queueing repaints.
A missing base makes the browser send `terminal.frame_ack { resync: true }` and
the bridge answers with a full frame. Attach and resize also restart from a
full frame, and a 10 s acknowledgement timeout releases the window. Viewers
that do not opt in, popups, and legacy streams keep base64 `bytes` repaints.
The browser writes only changed rows into xterm while its viewport is unchanged.

The browser reports its terminal colors with `terminal.host_theme`
(`appearance`, `foreground`, `background`, 16-color `palette`). Every endpoint
client of that connection forwards them as Herdr `ClientShellHostTheme`
updates (default colors, palette, then appearance), including right after each
welcome, so a Thyra client promoted to foreground never resets panes to an
empty host theme. A light/dark change also blurs and refocuses the focused pane
once so apps that re-probe colors on focus pick it up.

Messages of at least 128 bytes use negotiated WebSocket compression with
per-connection context for WebKit compatibility, so repeated rows and poll
replies compress against earlier messages. Clipboard payloads stay
uncompressed. Inbound decompression is shared with client context takeover
disabled; backpressure and generation checks still apply.

### Geometry, input, and selection

`terminal.attach` supplies pane `cols`/`rows` and optionally tab
`surface_cols`/`surface_rows` (both integers in 1..65535). Tab dimensions include
pane borders, not app chrome; surface feedback corrects stale hints. Legacy
attachments use pane dimensions. Repaints clip wide characters and cursors to
the viewer's viewport; browsers reject oversized frames after shrinking.

Root CSS zoom scales the UI. Terminals cancel it and scale xterm fonts directly,
keeping cell measurements, IME, selection, and mouse input in viewport CSS pixels.
Popover positioning likewise cancels zoom and reapplies it to content.

The first output renders with xterm's DOM renderer in a fallback font; the WebGL renderer and the bundled font load after it (`terminalRenderer.ts`).
Neither may change `cols`/`rows`, which would reflow a full-screen app: cell widths snap to device pixels as the WebGL renderer's do, the fit uses that grid whichever renderer is active, and the bundled font's cell size is fixed before it downloads (its nominal metrics, or the size this browser measured on an earlier load).

Input waits for readiness and revalidates attachment/session/runtime leases;
it is never replayed into a replacement terminal. Disconnect rejects pending
requests and invalidates clipboard ownership.

- Full PageUp/PageDown sends semantic input for Herdr to route by PTY mode;
  explicit half-page history uses `pane.scroll`, even in mouse-aware apps.
  Legacy attachments retain PageKey/Wheel routing.
- Mouse cells are zero-based and pane-local. Only an in-pane press owns a drag;
  subsequent positions clamp to edges. Reporting changes/closure cancel ownership.
- History scrolling coalesces wheel intent while awaiting RPC and viewport
  feedback, without blocking other commands. No-op replies need no repaint.
  Completed movement is not rebased by history growth; external viewport changes
  become authoritative when no newer intent is queued. Input, missing metrics or
  panes, and closure cancel queued movement.
- Browser selection holds the latest repaint until cleared. Session changes
  retire pending presentation; replay never sends input. Edge-drag, or a wheel
  over an existing selection, promotes it to absolute history rows and reads one
  overlapping viewport at a time, retaining immutable cells for the complete
  copied range. New output may change the content revision; each new viewport
  must reproduce the captured rows it overlaps (the live bottom page excepted),
  otherwise history shifted and further requests stop with captured text kept.
  Release, blur, lost mouse-up, resize, or reset stops edge scrolling; after
  release, wheel scrolling keeps the range and Shift-click extends it.
- Finished selections are copied inside the releasing gesture (mouseup,
  touchend, handle pointerup) because WebKit rejects clipboard writes outside
  user activation. A drag handed to a mouse-aware app reserves a
  `ClipboardItem` write at mouseup that its later OSC 52 copy fulfills.

### Links

Local detection scans soft-wrapped text with cell coordinates. File detection
also considers bounded, indented continuations because endpoint cell repaints
lack soft-wrap metadata; inferred paths must resolve within the pane's workspace.
Blank lines separate contexts. Local URL detection never guesses missing tails.

Endpoint repaints carry an opaque `link_frame` identity, stable across identical,
cursor-only, and focus-only surfaces. Content, hyperlink, viewport/scroll, input,
or resize changes invalidate it. Identical repaints do not rewrite xterm, keeping
native link IDs and in-progress clicks intact.

`terminal.link.resolve` verifies attachment ownership and frame identity. OSC 8
uses the cropped frame's hyperlink table; optional plain-text resolution runs on
that exact socket with its content revision and scroll offset. Coordinates are
zero-based **cropped-pane display cells**, never surface origins or CSS pixels.
Hover probes are bounded and independently timed out; hover never activates.

Herdr 0.9.1's `pane.link.resolve` returns inclusive visible regions, not URLs.
Thyra reconstructs complete HTTP(S) targets, including wrapped/wide cells,
but rejects ambiguous viewport-clipped URLs. It never calls `pane.link.activate`,
which can invoke host plugin handlers. OSC 8 retains explicit destinations even
for partial labels. Local `file://` targets require decoded absolute host paths
and empty/`localhost` authorities; network hosts, UNC paths, credentials,
queries/fragments, malformed encoding, and control characters are rejected.
Other URI schemes are not opened.

Async lookups recheck frame, buffer, geometry, navigation, and connection state,
even while selection freezes presentation. Once clicked, a file menu survives
ordinary output but closes on connection/workspace/navigation changes. Web links
open in the browser; files use the pane's workspace, not later global focus.

Touch long-press resolves the original touched cell, with at most one upstream
probe, then requires an explicit **Open link** or **File actions** gesture.
Selection edits, cancellation, multitouch, scrolling, frame changes, resize, and
reconnect retire lookups. Unsafe explicit OSC 8 targets and failed endpoint touch
reads never fall back to URL-looking labels. Legacy touch supports plain-text
URLs/paths only, without explicit OSC 8 cell metadata.

## Browser navigation and creation

`browserNavigation.ts` projects endpoint browser-local selections into shared UI
fields. Snapshots supply topology, not subsequent navigation; stale layouts and
results cannot overwrite newer selections. Legacy navigation, topology changes,
terminal dimensions, and native same-tab pane focus remain shared.

Active selection/clicks send `terminal.focus` through the attached `pane.focus`
endpoint. Focus restores after split attachment, not on routine frames/snapshots.
Requests serialize per browser across endpoint lanes; superseded selections are
discarded and ownership/leases rechecked. Same-tab cursor ownership remains shared.

Creation uses explicit context and `focus: false`; returned IDs are adopted only
while the initiating selection and lease remain current. The bridge validates
and strips Thyra-only `browser_source`, then uses the existing endpoint's
serialized focus/scroll lane without another endpoint or focus call. Omitting
synthetic cwd preserves Herdr's `terminal.new_cwd`; explicit cwd wins. Shared
same-tab focus still controls the `follow` source.

Missing source attachments fail. Only first-workspace bootstrap uses control
creation, serializing an empty-topology check per runtime. Competing requests
retry when topology becomes nonempty. A 20-second admission deadline covers
readiness, validation, and queuing: expired undispatched mutations never execute;
dispatched timeouts report uncertain completion, requiring inspection before retry.

The project launcher's `launcher.launch { path, agent }` is the one other control-API creation.
It always passes an explicit cwd, so no source terminal or `terminal.new_cwd` policy is involved, and it uses `focus: false` under browser-local navigation (the initiating browser then selects the returned pane).
The bridge accepts only a known agent ID, expands `~` with the runtime host's home, and checks that the path is a directory on that host before creating anything.
It adds a tab to the workspace whose checkout (or, failing that, most panes) is that folder, or creates a workspace there, waits up to three seconds for the shell to draw output, then sends the server-configured command with `pane.send_input` and Enter.
A failed send is returned as `start_error` next to the created tab rather than hiding it.

## Workspace resource ownership

A **checkout** owns Files/Changes; a workspace supplies routing, a tab a return
location, and a pane optional path/session context. Repository groups are not
merged working trees. Changes and Last step snapshots do not prove agent ownership.

Git resource keys pair endpoint-qualified `worktree.gui_settings_key` with the
normalized checkout path, scoped by connection. Blank keys fall back to the
trimmed repository key, which cannot distinguish endpoints; enriched identities
do not inherit fallback state. Persistent keys exclude runtime generations.
Non-Git resources use workspace identity.

Shared-checkout workspaces may share caches, but requests retain workspace/runtime
leases and resource revisions. Refresh/removal retires old prefetches. Tab/pane
IDs never own caches. Legacy repository-wide Inspector state is retained but not
automatically migrated because it lacks checkout identity.

Actions capture the originating workspace. A vanished workspace can rebind only
to the same checkout; missing paths never fall back to siblings. Agent cwd is
used only inside the checkout. Removal clears only that checkout's state; closing
one workspace retains resources another workspace still uses. Terminals stay
mounted across Inspector changes; layout preferences and content caches are separate.

## Filesystem browsing

Workspace scope is checkout-relative and lexically confined: `..` escapes are
rejected, while explicit symlinks inside the checkout may be followed. Each
filesystem request explicitly sends `scope: "filesystem"` with an absolute host
path or `~`/`~/...`; the bridge expands `~` with the runtime host's home (the
bridge user locally, the remote shell's `$HOME` over SSH, cached per host), and
replies confirm scope and return absolute paths. The mode is view-local, not a
persisted permission: each explorer remembers its mode and directory in memory
for the page session only, and retired responses cannot replace a new view.
Search filters loaded entries only.

`file.list`, `file.read`, download, upload, delete, and `file.mkdir` accept both
scopes. Upload targets an explicit directory; delete and `file.mkdir` target an
entry inside an existing parent. `file.mkdir` takes `kind: "directory" | "file"`,
creates one empty entry, and fails when the name exists. Deleting the checkout
root, a filesystem root, or the host home directory itself is refused.

Absolute previews use `scope=filesystem` download URLs; relative Markdown links
and images resolve beside their source. Explorer caches are separate from lazy
UI code. Mermaid previews share a lazy
renderer, strip wrappers/metadata only for detection, and retain original source.
Images are inert elements; SVG is never inserted into the app DOM, and direct
SVG responses carry a sandbox CSP blocking scripts and external resources.

HTML previews use a separate empty-sandbox iframe and an enforcing response CSP,
including on direct navigation. The server embeds workspace CSS, images and fonts
as data URLs; Bun's CSS bundler resolves imports and asset URLs. Relative paths
resolve beside their document or stylesheet; root-relative paths resolve within
its workspace. Realpath checks reject resources outside that workspace. HTTPS
stylesheets and their CSS imports are loaded directly by the browser, not fetched
by the bridge; protocol-relative stylesheet URLs use HTTPS. Stylesheet links use
`no-referrer`, and document-supplied referrer metadata is removed. CDN requests
expose the viewer's IP address and are not covered by workspace read limits.
Scripts, forms, embedded documents, external images/fonts and HTTP stylesheets
are blocked. Missing or unsupported workspace resources are omitted. Ordinary
downloads retain original bytes.

HTML and each workspace stylesheet are limited to 512 KiB, each workspace
image/font to 5 MiB, and a preview to 64 resource paths and 10 MiB of resource
bytes. Resource-bearing style processing is limited to 256 blocks/attributes,
with a 20 MiB embedding/output budget. Local and SSH readers check size and read
at most the limit plus one byte to detect growth; oversized previews return
HTTP 413. HTML requests have a 120-second HTTP idle timeout for preparation over
SSH. The source view and downloads remain available.
These limits do not bound decoded image memory or browser rendering cost. User
links and deliberate copy/drag into other controls remain untrusted user actions.

## File editing

`file.write` saves UTF-8 editor content: `{ workspace_id, path, content,
expected_mtime_ms?, force?, scope? }` returns `{ path, size, mtime_ms, created }`.
Workspace scope takes checkout-relative paths with the same lexical confinement
as other file operations; `scope: "filesystem"` takes an absolute host path.
Writes replace an existing regular file (resolving symlinks to their target) or
create one in an existing directory, never a directory. Content lands in a
sibling temporary file that keeps the original mode and is renamed into place.
`expected_mtime_ms` must match the current modification time unless `force` is
set; a mismatch fails with "file changed on disk". SSH runs the check, temporary
write, and rename in one remote script with one-second mtime resolution, matching
previews. Bodies are limited to 5 MiB. Clean drafts follow reloads; saves
invalidate the preview cache and refresh rendered previews.

The Monaco editor is a lazy chunk with Monarch grammars and only the base editor
worker; language-service workers are excluded and nothing loads from a CDN.

## Agent activity

`agent.list` adds optional `last_activity_at` from session-file mtime without
parsing transcripts. Checks have bounded concurrency and a 1.5-second budget;
missing metadata never removes agents. Remote IDs needing local directory search
stay unresolved. Idle ordering uses mtime, then Herdr state-change sequence,
without browser activity history. [History synchronization](./HISTORY.md) owns
projection, caching, and incremental transcript contracts.

## Agent integrations

`integration.list` keeps Herdr's targets and installation states authoritative.
Missing versions are supplemented by read-only `herdr integration status` on the
selected host: locally for local connections, or through that connection's SSH
account. The CLI binary version must match the running server's `ping` version;
per-agent state and any existing version fields must agree before merging.
The bridge/SSH account must use the same agent configuration environment as Herdr.
RPC metadata is never overwritten, and a `current` state alone does not imply an
available version. CLI commands have five-second timeouts; missing binaries,
failed SSH commands, malformed output, and version mismatches leave missing
metadata unknown without failing the list. There is no remote-to-local fallback.

## Voice input

The AudioContext is created and resumed synchronously in the tap handler, before any `await`, because iOS Safari only starts audio during a user gesture; an interrupted context (calls, app switches) resumes when the page is visible again.
Capture requests the browser's WebRTC audio processing (noise suppression, echo cancellation, automatic gain control).
The AudioContext runs at the device rate, because browsers resample a 48 kHz microphone into a 16 kHz context without adequate filtering and recognition accuracy suffers; the AudioWorklet applies a windowed-sinc low-pass filter, downsamples to 16 kHz, and runs voice activity detection.
Detection uses the WebRTC VAD (libfvad from the pinned `@echogarden/fvad-wasm` build, mode 3) on 20 ms frames together with an adaptive energy threshold: a frame is voiced only when both agree, because energy alone accepts typing and broadband noise and the WebRTC VAD alone accepts quiet steady noise.
Worklets cannot fetch, so the main thread passes the 20 KiB WASM as bytes and the worklet compiles it synchronously; if that fails, detection falls back to energy alone.
A segment commits after 500 ms of trailing silence, needs 320 ms of voiced audio, is forced out at 12 s, and is dropped unless it lasts 650 ms and reaches RMS 0.006 or peak 0.025; the speech threshold adapts to the background level between utterances.
Segments are posted in order as canonical 16 kHz mono PCM16 WAV to bridge-global `POST /api/voice/transcribe`, which validates the header, bounds size (300 s) and concurrency, and tries each configured provider in order until one succeeds.
Segment transcripts are a live preview. On stop, when a session produced more than one segment, its speech-only audio (segments joined by 250 ms of silence, up to 300 s) is recognized again as one request, and that transcript replaces the preview, because recognizers lose context at segment boundaries; if the pass fails, the segment transcripts stand.
The personal dictionary (Aoide's `dictionary.yaml` format) is re-read when its file changes; its terms go to OpenAI as the transcription prompt, optionally to ElevenLabs as keyterms, and to cleanup as hints, and confirmed aliases are replaced in every transcript and cleanup result.

Pane voice typing follows Aoide's speak-then-commit flow: transcripts collect in a preview, and stopping cleans the whole dictation once through `POST /api/voice/cleanup` and sends it with `pane.send_input` like a composer Insert (Send adds Enter).
The active pane also listens for the `voice.pushToTalk` shortcut in the window capture phase, ahead of the terminal: a press held at least 350 ms is push-to-talk and its release inserts, a shorter tap starts dictation that the next press inserts, and while dictating Enter sends and Escape discards.
The key press is the gesture that unlocks audio, and a release that arrives while the microphone is still opening stops it as soon as it is ready.
If the send fails, the text is kept in that pane's composer draft.
In the composer, transcripts are inserted at the caret, and the composer records the contiguous range one session wrote.
On stop, the cleanup result replaces that range only if the draft still holds the raw dictation at the recorded offset, so edits made while tidying are never overwritten.

Cleanup keeps the recognized text instead of the model's rewrite when the rewrite keeps under 45% of the word characters (for inputs of at least 25), under half of the English words (for at least five), changes the digits (ignoring added list markers), or drops a dictionary term that was spoken; the bridge logs which check fired.
The capture code loads on first use; unmounting the pane or closing the composer releases the microphone.

## Task notifications

Each runtime tracks agent transitions through per-pane subscriptions and periodic
reconciliation, even without browsers. Initial state is silent; snapshots cannot
overwrite newer events. Transitions emit once; disposal stops observation and
queued sends recheck the owning lease.

Web Push persists private VAPID keys and device subscriptions. Authenticated
same-origin HTTP manages enrollment/revocation; encrypted sends use a provider
allowlist, ten-second deadline, four concurrent requests, and a bounded
256-delivery memory queue. Failures/overflow are logged, not durably replayed.
The Service Worker checks connection generation when routing clicks; enrolled
pages suppress duplicate local notifications. See [delivery limits](./DEPLOYMENT.md#web-push-notifications).

## Browser collaboration and terminal ownership

Each browser page receives an ephemeral participant ID; only its display name
and color are shared through browser storage. This keeps tabs, windows, and
separate browser sessions distinct while allowing one participant session to
hold claims on several panes. Presence reports include the active workspace,
tab, and pane.

Pane claims are exclusive per pane, not per Herdr session. The bridge shares one
render stream for a terminal among all watching browsers. `Take control` claims
layout ownership with a 15-second takeover protection; keyboard input remains
shared among editors. Non-owners preserve an existing shared terminal's
dimensions on attachment. Pane viewing mode blocks local keyboard, IME, paste,
composer, focus, and resize commands while allowing explicit history scrolling;
it is a browser-local preference, not an authorization boundary.

The bridge first forwards `collaboration.*` calls to the Herdr control socket.
Herdr versions without that API return an unknown-method response, which selects
a bridge-local lease map with the same response shape. If a stock direct client
or another bridge already controls the terminal, the browser falls back to
observe mode and does not evict it until the user chooses **Take control**.

## SSH transport

Each runtime supervises one OpenSSH process forwarding both sockets into a private
temporary directory. Readiness requires control `ping` and render handshake.
Transient failures retry six times with cancellable backoff capped at 30 seconds,
reset after 30 seconds stable-ready. Authentication, host-key, and permanent
protocol failures do not retry. Post-ready exit retires the generation first.
CLI SSH uses the same probes without persistence or automatic retry.

Only OpenSSH aliases or `user@host` are accepted, after `--` with fixed options.
Host-key checks remain enabled; service authentication is noninteractive. OpenSSH
configuration owns credentials/options. Stderr is bounded/sanitized. Cleanup
removes owned paths only after confirmed child exit; otherwise it preserves them
and reports failure. Host operations share this boundary; see [connection setup](./DEPLOYMENT.md#multiple-and-remote-herdr-connections).

## Distribution model

Production embeds frontend assets and Bun into one executable; targets need no
Bun/Node.js. Builds use the `thyra` release identity across binaries, archives,
checksums, and manifests. Missing or invalid manifests fail closed without archive
discovery. Publication requires exactly the six platform asset sets.

## Web delivery and caching

Everything under `/assets/` is content-addressed (Vite output and the sliced terminal font) and is served `private, max-age=31536000, immutable`; never write an unfingerprinted file there.
`index.html`, `/manifest.json`, the service worker and `/thyra-assets.json` are served `no-cache, must-revalidate` with a strong per-encoding `ETag`, so revalidation costs a `304`.
Text files of at least 1 KiB are sent as Brotli (quality 11) or else gzip, compressed once per file version off the event loop.
At startup the bridge compresses the entry document's assets and the build's `boot` list (the terminal view's static closure and font stylesheets) before the first request.

The first screen downloads only the entry and the terminal view's closure; the page opens its WebSocket before rendering, so the socket does not queue behind those chunks for a browser's six HTTP/1.1 connections.
Everything else waits for the first terminal output (`startupGate.ts`): the WebGL renderer, the terminal font (a small ASCII/Latin-1/Powerline stylesheet, then the CJK and icon chunks when idle), warmups, prefetches and the service worker.
The gate's fallback for output that never comes starts only once a terminal attach has completed, so it cannot expire while the terminal code is still downloading.
Zstandard and compression dictionaries are not offered: WebKit supports neither, and quality-11 Brotli is smaller than zstd for these bundles.

The build splits long-lived vendor code into `vendor-react`, `vendor-xterm`, `vendor-ui` (only UI-library modules the entry loads eagerly) and the lazy `vendor-aria` (React Aria for overlays) chunks, so an app-only update does not re-download them (`web/vite.chunks.ts`).
Chunks that import from the entry still change with it.
It also writes `thyra-assets.json` with a build `version`, every file under `/assets/`, and the `boot` list.

Production pages that are not yet controlled register one service worker, `/task-notifications-sw.js` at scope `/`, after the `load` event and the first terminal output (`startupGate.ts`); it also handles Web Push, so there is never a second worker.
Once active it claims open pages, and the page asks it to copy the assets it loaded before control (normally from the HTTP cache).
- `/assets/*` GETs without a query or `Range` are cache-first in `thyra-assets-v1`; only `200` same-origin, non-redirected, non-HTML responses marked `immutable` are stored.
- Navigations to `/` or `/index.html` without a query are network-first: the network response (including login redirects and errors) is returned unchanged, and the cached shell in `thyra-shell-v1` answers only when the network fails or has not answered within 4 seconds.
  Only `200` same-origin, non-redirected HTML is stored as the shell.
- Every other request (API routes, `/ws`, `/login`, token-login queries, file previews, non-GET methods) bypasses the worker.
- When a stored shell changes, the worker fetches `/thyra-assets.json` and deletes cached assets used by neither the new nor the previous build, so a page started from a stale shell can finish loading.
  Activation deletes every other `thyra-*` cache; bump the cache names when the stored format or strategy changes.

A stale shell can therefore run one load after a deploy when the network is slower than the fallback timeout; the refreshed shell is used on the next load.

## Trust boundary

Thyra is trusted single-user administration, not a sandbox or multi-user
permission system. Listener access and required authentication grant authority;
see [Security](../SECURITY.md#trust-model) for loopback, TLS, and outer access controls.

The browser accepts one unscoped bridge hello before other messages. Message kinds
are exclusive and validated; downstream events cannot inject reserved bridge
fields. NDJSON lines/acknowledgements are bounded; malformed terminal frames are
dropped. Observable HTTP traversal is rejected, but Bun may normalize dot segments
before routing; legacy aliases prevent distinguishing every such normalization.
